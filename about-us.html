    </center>
    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">That's us!
        We are two developers who are unfortunately mainly still in school. As we are very interested in informatics we use our free time to learn about the technologies of our future.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;color: #0055ff;" >• Yaros</h4>
    <p align="justify">Hello! I am Yaros, I was born in the year 2006 in Kyiv, Ukraine. I always wanted to learn how to code, but it seemed too hard for me. Now I am writing some simple apps to get better at it!
        When I was 12 years old I started learning to code, creating some simple programs for Windows using Python and Kivy, now with Lucas we are expanding our knowledge to make mobile apps!
        Together with Lucas we are creating some apps to learn to code together!
        When we started making our first app (365 facts) I never thought it will be so complete, although kind of basic in some ways but it was extremely fun to work on!
        We like to make some useful and just fun apps for Android (we would like for iOS too but it's just expensive) in Python Kivy and some games in Unity C#! 
        We also like to split our work between both of us, for example, I mainly work on code, optimizing the apps and fixing some bugs, while Lucas in that time manages to provide us with an excelent UI/UX design, icons, ideas and report bugs to fix, he also helps me with some tough parts of bug-fixing and coding! I think we are a brilliant team, let's see what we can create together!

    <p>Hi! That's me!</p>
    <p align="justify">I am Lucas, I was born in 2007 in the capital of Germany, Berlin. Since 1st grade, I have been living in one of the Balearic Islands of Spain. Since my childhood, I have been very interested in technology but above all in informatics.
        I love to learn something new every day, and that's how my friend Yaros and I came up with our first app idea (365 Facts), and the general mind-blowing idea of developing our own app. 
        I was fortunate enough to be able to grow up multilingual. This enabled me to learn German, Spanish, English, Catalan, and a little bit of Russian. On the side, I'm currently learning Mandarin.
